# I moved the command to a variable to fix some quoting issues with
# nix-shell. Without this, the command to run tests got parsed as:
#
# nix-shell --command 'python -m' unittest discover
#
# With the variable, it's correctly parsed as:
#
# nix-shell --command 'python -m unittest discover'
#
# (This might have something to do with exactly how Emacs wraps up
# command-line arguments.)
