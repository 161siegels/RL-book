## Abstract

Machine learning—like scientific computing in general—requires a substantial amount of programming. Programming effectively requires not just writing any kind of code that works, but organizing code along conceptual lines so that it is easier to understand, reason about, modify and debug. This chapter introduces software engineering concepts useful for writing better numeric code, focused on designing domain-specific abstractions and interfaces. Each concept is illustrated with Python code, which also introduces core Python features used throughout the rest of the book: classes, inheritance, abstract classes, static types, generic programming, dataclasses, immutability, first-class functions, lambdas, iterators and generators.
