## Abstract

Machine learning—like scientific computing in general—requires a substantial amount of programming. Programming effectively is not only a matter of writing code that works, but also organizing code along conceptual lines so that it is easier to understand, modify and debug. This chapter introduces software engineering concepts useful for writing higher-quality code, focused on designing domain-specific abstractions and interfaces. Each concept is illustrated with Python code, which also introduces core Python features used throughout the rest of the book: classes, inheritance, abstract classes, static types, generic programming, dataclasses, immutability, first-class functions, lambdas, iterators and generators.

# Chapter 1: Markov Processes

Chapter author: Ashwin Rao

## Abstract

Reinforcement learning involves making sequential decisions under sequential uncertainty. Markov processes (Markov chains) and Markov reward processes provide a formal framework for modeling sequential uncertainty without decision-making. This chapter starts by introducing processes defined in terms of states and transition functions, then expands to Markov processes by formalizing what it means for a process to be "time-homogenous" or "time-invariant" (the Markov property). Next, the chapter extends Markov processes to Markov reward processes by introducing rewards as part of the transition function and finally covering the value function of a Markov reward process in terms of the Bellman equation. The Python definitions in this chapter set up the programming framework that acts as a foundation for the examples and algorithms in the rest of the book.
