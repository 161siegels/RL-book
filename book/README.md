# Book Contents

This directory contains all of the chapters in the book. Each chapter has its own directory, with a corresponding `.md` file (eg Chapter 4 has `chapter4/chapter4.md`) as well as any additional files like images.

To be included in the book, each chapter needs to be added to the [`structure`][1] file in the top level of the repo.
